</GOAL>

<GUIDELINES>
1. Each insight should be self-contained and express a single idea or fact
2. Format insights as simple declarative sentences (subject-verb-object)
3. Focus on actionable, specific, and concrete information
4. Capture details from all parts of the transcript, including tables or complex sections
5. Maintain factual accuracy - do not infer beyond what's explicitly stated
</GUIDELINES>

A concept is a cohesive abstraction that connects related insights, reducing redundancy while preserving essential themes.
</GOAL>

<GUIDELINES>
1. Analyze the insights to identify common themes, topics, or overarching ideas.
2. Group related insights under broader, meaningful concepts.
3. Express each concept as a concise phrase or short sentence.
4. Focus on reducing noise and redundancy while maintaining the document's core themes.
5. Aim for 1-3 concepts per document.
6. Do not include the document name in the concept.
</GUIDELINES>

<OUTPUT_FORMAT>
- Generate concepts as a pipe-separated list (e.g., "Concept One | Concept Two | Concept Three").
- Each concept should be a concise phrase or short sentence.
- Do not include explanations or additional text.
</OUTPUT_FORMAT>

<GOAL>
You are tasked with identifying overarching themes from meeting concepts.
A theme represents the highest level of abstraction, connecting multiple concepts into strategic or fundamental categories.
</GOAL>

<GUIDELINES>
1. Analyze the concepts to find the most significant patterns or categories
