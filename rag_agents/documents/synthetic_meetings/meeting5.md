**Date:** October 9, 2023  
**Attendees:** Alex (Team Lead), Jamie (Developer), Taylor (Developer), Sam (Developer)

**Transcript:**

**Alex:** Morning, team! October 9th—updates, please. Taylor?

**Taylor:** Hey! Mobile app’s got login, payments, and a basic dashboard view now. I’ve started testing on iOS and Android—couple of UI glitches to fix. Chatbot-wise, I’ve got Dialogflow hooked up for basic queries.

**Jamie:** I helped Taylor with mobile debugging—mostly CSS quirks. For SSO, I’ve set up a test environment with Okta. It’s working for the web app; mobile integration’s next.

**Sam:** Dashboard customizations are done—users can pick metrics and save preferences. I’ve deployed it for internal testing. Found a small latency issue I’m fixing.

**Alex:** Nice work, all. Taylor, mobile prototype—ready to demo soon?

**Taylor:** End of this week, I think.

**Alex:** Great. Jamie, SSO for mobile—how’s that fit in?

**Jamie:** I can start this week—shouldn’t take long.

**Alex:** Cool. Sam, latency fix—priority?

**Sam:** Yeah, I’ll knock it out by tomorrow.

**Alex:** Alright. New project: GDPR compliance. We need to audit our data handling. Thoughts?

**Jamie:** I can take a first pass—update policies, check logs.

**Alex:** Perfect. Action items: Taylor, mobile demo and chatbot polish. Jamie, SSO mobile and GDPR audit. Sam, latency fix and test dashboard.

**Sam:** Sounds good.

**Alex:** Anything else?

**Taylor:** Nope, we’re rolling!

**Alex:** Awesome. See you next time!
