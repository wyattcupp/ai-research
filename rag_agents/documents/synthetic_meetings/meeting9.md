**Alex:** Morning, team! October 17th—updates. Taylor?

**Taylor:** Hey! Mobile soft launch went live yesterday—no crashes so far. Release prep’s on track—auth, payments, dashboard all tested. Sent release notes to marketing.

**Sam:** Dashboard’s polished—customizations and performance are tight. Added a loading spinner for charts; users love it.

**Alex:** Fantastic. Any last release hurdles?

**Taylor:** Just monitoring post-launch—need a plan.
