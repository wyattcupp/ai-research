**Date:** October 11, 2023  
**Attendees:** Alex (Team Lead), Jamie (Developer), Taylor (Developer), Sam (Developer)

**Transcript:**

**Alex:** Hey, team! October 11th—let’s get into it. Jamie?

**Jamie:** Morning! SSO’s live on mobile—tested with Okta, works great. GDPR audit’s underway—I’ve updated our privacy policy and flagged some logging gaps we need to fix.

**Taylor:** Mobile prototype’s ready—login, payments, dashboard, all functional. I’ve fixed those UI bugs and started chatbot training with more financial queries. Testing’s ongoing.

**Sam:** Dashboard latency’s resolved—switched to a caching layer. It’s snappy now. I’ve been helping Jamie with GDPR—looking at data retention rules next.

**Alex:** Solid updates. Taylor, demo this week?

**Taylor:** Yup, I’ll schedule it for Friday.

**Alex:** Excited to see it. Jamie, GDPR gaps—how urgent?

**Jamie:** Logging fixes by next week; retention’s less pressing.

**Alex:** Got it. Bad news—a security vuln popped up in auth. Token refresh exploit. Jamie, can you lead on this?

**Jamie:** Yep, I’ll dig in today—might need a hotfix.

**Alex:** Please do. Action items: Jamie, security fix and GDPR logs. Taylor, mobile demo and chatbot. Sam, assist Jamie with GDPR.

**Sam:** On it.

**Alex:** Anything else?

**Taylor:** Nope, good to go.

**Alex:** Alright, let’s move fast on that vuln. Thanks, team!
