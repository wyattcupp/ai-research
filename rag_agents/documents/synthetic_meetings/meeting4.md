**Date:** October 7, 2023  
**Attendees:** Alex (Team Lead), Jamie (Developer), Taylor (Developer), Sam (Developer)

**Transcript:**

**Alex:** Hey, everyone! October 7th—let’s hear those updates. Sam?

**Sam:** Morning! Dashboard customizations are coming along—I’ve got a dropdown for metric selection working. Still tweaking the UI, but it’s usable. Should be ready for testing soon.

**Taylor:** Mobile app’s progressing—I’ve built out the payment screen, tied to Stripe and PayPal. Jamie’s login is integrated, and it’s looking smooth. Also, I researched chatbots—Dialogflow seems solid and quick to set up.

**Jamie:** Yeah, I wrapped up mobile auth yesterday—OAuth2 and MFA are in. Now I’m helping Taylor with mobile features. On another note, I started looking into single sign-on for the web app—SSO could streamline things.

**Alex:** Love that SSO idea, Jamie. How’s the timeline on that?

**Jamie:** Maybe next sprint—it’s not urgent but worth planning.

**Alex:** Fair. Taylor, what’s next for mobile?

**Taylor:** I’ll finish the core features—dashboard view, payments—and start testing. Chatbot setup can kick off after.

**Alex:** Good. Sam, dashboard testing—next week?

**Sam:** Yup, I’ll have it ready.

**Alex:** Alright, let’s talk release planning. We need auth, payments, and dashboard solid. Mobile can be a bonus. Action items: Sam, finalize customizations. Taylor, mobile features and chatbot. Jamie, assist Taylor and prep SSO.

**Taylor:** Any blockers on the release?

**Alex:** Not yet—let’s keep testing tight. Anything else?

**Sam:** All good here.

**Alex:** Cool. Keep it up, team!
