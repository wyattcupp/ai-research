**Transcript:**

**Alex:** Good morning, everyone! Welcome to our first Project Planning and Updates meeting for this sprint. It’s October 1st, and we’re here to align on what’s been happening and plan the next two weeks. Let’s start with updates—Jamie, want to kick us off?

**Jamie:** Sure thing, Alex. I’ve been working on the user authentication module. Last week, I got the OAuth2 flow implemented for login. It’s mostly working, but I had some hiccups with the redirect URLs. I’ve sorted that out now, and my next step is integrating it with our user database and making sure token validation is rock-solid.

**Taylor:** Nice work, Jamie. I’ve been tackling the payment processing integration with Stripe. I’ve set up the API keys and ran some test transactions in the sandbox—credit card payments are looking good so far. I still need to add support for PayPal and maybe Apple Pay down the line, and I’ve started digging into PCI DSS compliance requirements.

**Sam:** Hey, all. I’ve been building the financial analytics dashboard. I’ve got the basic layout done in React and hooked up Chart.js for the charts. Right now, I’m working on fetching real-time data from our backend via WebSockets. I hit a snag with the connection dropping, but I think I’ve fixed it—just need to test it more.

**Alex:** Awesome, thanks for the updates, everyone. It sounds like we’re off to a solid start. Let’s talk priorities for the next two weeks. Jamie, how’s the authentication module looking timeline-wise?

**Jamie:** I’d say I can wrap up the database integration and token stuff by the end of next week, assuming no major surprises.

**Taylor:** For payments, I want to get PayPal integrated and make sure we’re PCI DSS compliant. That compliance piece might take a bit longer, so I’ll prioritize the integration first.

**Sam:** I’d love to get the dashboard to a point where we can demo it internally. Real-time data is almost there, but I need to start on the data aggregation—like calculating totals and averages. Might need some backend help for that.

**Alex:** Okay, let’s set some goals then. Jamie, aim to finish the authentication module by next Friday. Taylor, get PayPal done and start on compliance. Sam, focus on the real-time data and begin the aggregation work. Speaking of which, we’ve got the mobile app on the horizon—any thoughts on who should take that?

**Taylor:** I can start researching frameworks once I’m through the payment stuff. React Native makes sense since we’re already using React.

**Alex:** Sounds good, Taylor. Let’s plan for you to kick that off after payments. Anything else we need to cover?

**Jamie:** Yeah, quick thing—I think we should do a code review soon. Some of the older auth code could use a cleanup.

**Alex:** Great call. Let’s schedule one for next week—I’ll send out an invite. Anything else?

**Sam:** Nope, I’m good.

**Taylor:** Same here.

**Alex:** Alright, team, let’s keep the momentum going. Thanks, and see you next time!
